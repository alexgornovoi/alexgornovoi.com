My resume website built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). I used this project as a way to replace my [old resume website](https://github.com/alexgornovoi/resume-website) which used Nextjs. I chose Astro due to how simple it was compared to Nextjs and due to how quickly it is able to load static content. Using Astro's content collections I am also easily able to update the content of this site as I create more projects and blogs.
